# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - README

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of the data science project. The goal of this phase is to explore the dataset, understand its characteristics, and identify potential relationships between variables.

## Project Structure
- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for exploratory data analysis.
- `metadata_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in the `metadata_cleaned.csv` file. It has been preprocessed and cleaned for EDA purposes.

## Notebook
- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration and analysis. It includes data profiling, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

## Getting Started
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the `EDA.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Results
The exploratory data analysis reveals insights into the dataset, including distribution of variables, relationships between variables, summary statistics, and potential outliers.
